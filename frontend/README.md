# ðŸ“Œ Momentum Project Overview

**Momentum** is a single-page web application (SPA), a modern, clean, and fully responsive web application designed to help you build and track your habits. This project was built with React to create a fast, dynamic, and engaging user experience from the ground up.  
The architecture is based on three main semantic blocks:  

- **Header** â€” responsive navigation bar (full menu on desktop, burger menu on mobile).  
- **Main** â€” dynamic content area with pages (HomePage, Login, Register) and an adaptive card grid.  
- **Footer** â€” minimalist footer with copyright information.  

The app uses **responsive design techniques** with Flexbox and CSS Grid, and includes smooth animations for improved user experience (UX).

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used

- **React** â€” for building a SPA interface.  
- **CSS Grid & Flexbox** â€” for layout and adaptive alignment.  
- **Media Queries** (`@media`) with breakpoints at `480px`, `768px`, `968px`.  
- **Relative Units** (`rem`, `%`, `vh`) for scalable design.  
- **CSS Transitions** â€” for hover animations and menu effects.  
- **Git + GitHub** â€” version control and project hosting.

- `src/pages/` â€” separate page components (HomePage, Login, Register).
